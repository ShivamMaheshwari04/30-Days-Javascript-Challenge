# Javascript Drum Kit - Day 01
I took the 30-Day Javascript Challenge, which helped me build a deep understanding of Javascript. In this challenge, we have to create 30 projects related to Javascript that will help you gain a better understanding of Javascript. The challenge is open to beginners and experienced developers alike. You don't need to have any prior JavaScript experience to participate, but it will be helpful if you have some basic HTML and CSS knowledge.Each day of the challenge, you'll learn a new JavaScript concept and then apply it to a project. The projects range from simple to complex, so you'll be challenged but never overwhelmed.I really enjoyed the challenge because it helped me learn JavaScript in a practical way. I was able to see how the concepts I was learning could be applied to real-world projects.

# About Project
In Javascript Drum Kit, I create a Javascript drum kit where the user can use keyboard keys to play a sound. In this project, I learn about getting elements,event listeners, playing audio, and adding or removing classes.They provide HTML and CSS files, where in the HTML file you can use script and add your functionality there. They also provide you with a video where the Wes Bros show you how to create a project and add functionality to your code.

# Where can I find this challenge?

One of my seniors told me that if you want to learn Javascript with a clear understanding, you have to create a good project that helps you get a clear understanding of Javascript. They suggest a 30-day Javascript challenge by Wes Bros. They also share their story about how this challenge helped him get a good command of JavaScript. I give you a website link where you put your email address and where you get all the project details in your email, and then you start learning and creating projects.
