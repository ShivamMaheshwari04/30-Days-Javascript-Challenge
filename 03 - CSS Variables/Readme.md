# On Day 3
On Day 3, I created an Image UI changer. Where I use variable update by javascript, it is very helpful when we want to update variables through user interaction. We can easily use variable update by javascript. In this project, I learn about getting data attributes,event listeners, and nodes for each loop and adding or removing classes Property.They provide HTML and CSS files, where in the HTML file you can use script and add your functionality there. They also provide you with a video where the Wes Bros show you how to create a project and add functionality to your code.
