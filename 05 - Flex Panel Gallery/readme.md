# Day - 5 

On Day 5, I created a Flex Panel Gallery where you can click an image and see that image scale vertically and text appear in a transition form. In this project, I learn about Flex, Flex-Basis, and Event Listener for each loop, transition, and transition end event. Wes Bros tutorial is now helping me get a good understanding of designing.
