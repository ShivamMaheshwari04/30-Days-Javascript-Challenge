🚀 Day 30 - The Grand Finale of the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge: Whack-a-Mole Game

We've reached the final day of our 30 Days JavaScript Challenge, and what better way to celebrate than by creating an interactive game? On Day 30, we delved into game development by building a classic Whack-a-Mole game. Here's what we learned:

🕹️ **Whack-a-Mole Game**: We crafted a digital version of the beloved Whack-a-Mole arcade game. Players must click on the moles as they randomly appear in different holes to earn points.

⏱️ **Time Constraints**: To add excitement, we imposed a time limit of 10 seconds. Players must whack as many moles as possible within this timeframe, challenging their reflexes and speed.

🎯 **Scoring System**: We implemented a scoring system to keep track of the player's performance. Every successful whack earns points, which are displayed in real-time.

🔄 **Randomization**: Moles pop up randomly from different holes at varying intervals, creating an unpredictable gaming experience. We utilized JavaScript's random functions for this feature.

💥 **Event Handling**: We handled click events on the moles to detect successful whacks. Additionally, we prevented cheating by verifying that the event was genuinely triggered by a click.

🌟 **Interactive Design**: Game development is a prime example of how JavaScript can be used to create engaging and interactive web applications. From classic games to modern web games, the possibilities are endless.

As we conclude this 30-day journey through JavaScript, we've equipped ourselves with a wealth of knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of web development projects. Stay inspired and keep coding! 🌐🎮 #WhackAMole #GameDevelopment #WebDevelopment #30DaysJSChallenge #InteractiveDesign
