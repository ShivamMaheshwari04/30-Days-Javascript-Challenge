# Day - 8
👋 Today is Day 8 of my 30-day JavaScript challenge, and I'm excited to share my latest project with you. I've created a dynamic drawing application from scratch, and the journey so far has been nothing short of amazing! 🎨

-I started by setting up the HTML canvas element and JavaScript to control it.

-The canvas dynamically resizes to fit the window, providing a responsive drawing space.

-I customized the drawing experience with vibrant colors, line thickness adjustments, and smooth line joins and caps.

# Key Takeaways:

🌈 Dynamic Colors: The drawing color changes as you go, thanks to HSL color formatting. It's a delightful feature that adds a touch of artistry to every stroke.

✒️ Responsive Drawing: I learned how to capture mouse events like mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup to enable drawing and track the user's input.

📐 Line Thickness Control: The line thickness increases and decreases as you draw. This is achieved by adjusting the ctx.lineWidth property dynamically.
